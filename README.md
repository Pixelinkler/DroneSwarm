# DroneSwarm
This repository contains the complete setup for controlling a swarm of drones using the DroneKit and MAVLink libraries in Python.
The system is designed with two main components:

    GCS (Ground Control Station)

    Drone Node (Raspberry Pi on each drone)

Each drone executes its mission from a CSV file, while the GCS monitors and manages the entire swarm.
